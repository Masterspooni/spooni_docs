Developed to address the limitations of conventional MLOs (Moveable Interior Loader) in custom mapping, MICO offers a wide array of features aimed at optimizing performance and improving the immersion of interior spaces.</p><h2 id="evolution-of-interior-mapping" tabindex="-1">Evolution of Interior Mapping <a class="header-anchor" href="#evolution-of-interior-mapping" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Evolution of Interior Mapping&quot;">​</a></h2><p>MICO has a history of product releases at SPOONI Mapping based on its underlying technology. It has now officially adopted the term &quot;MICO&quot; to encapsulate its innovative approach to interior mapping. This marks the beginning of a more organized and cohesive development strategy for interior mapping solutions.</p><h2 id="key-features" tabindex="-1">Key Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Features&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Weatherproof Interiors</strong>: MICO ensures that interior spaces remain unaffected by weather effects, such as rain and snow. This feature provides a consistent environment for role-playing and other activities within these spaces.</p><p><strong>Seamless Lighting Harmony</strong>: One of MICO&#39;s core strengths is its ability to synchronize interior lighting with the external time cycle. This creates a seamless transition between indoor and outdoor lighting, enhancing realism and immersion.</p><p><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: MICO is engineered to be highly performance-friendly. It eliminates the resource-intensive dimension loading often associated with traditional MLOs, allowing server owners to implement custom interiors without compromising server performance.</p><p><strong>Artisanal Shadows</strong>: MICO introduces the concept of &quot;artisanal shadows.&quot; Our coding DEV&#39;s meticulously craft different types of shadows to enhance the atmosphere within interior spaces, adding a layer of depth and realism.</p><p><strong>User Empowerment</strong>: While MICO offers precision and advanced features, it also empowers users to make modifications to interior spaces with ease. By using simple YMAP changes, users can tailor interiors to their unique visions.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-mico" tabindex="-1">The Future of MICO <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-future-of-mico" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Future of MICO&quot;">​</a></h2><p>MICO is committed to continuous improvement and innovation. Expect further enhancements, additional features, and exciting developments in the future as it aims to redefine the possibilities of interior mapping in the RedM environment.</p><p>Explore the future of interior mapping with the <strong>MICO system</strong> and <strong>SPOONI</strong>!</p>',14),a=[r];function s(p,c,d,m,h,l){return o(),t("div",null,a)}const g=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
